# Robo-model
This is the front end of a single page that generates new robo models everytime we refresh the page. This has a specific search box to search the model and also it shows loading when page is being loaded.  

Create a folder in your computer with the name of robo friends 
You can copy paste the entire files, but there are too many of them. To save time -
create a new react app in the same folder using the command 

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

This will create and open the react app for you and you can change the files in src repacing these I have attached here
